# Gender & Age Prediction System (CNN Model)

A deep learning–based system that predicts gender and age from face images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The model is trained on the UTKFace dataset with proper preprocessing, feature extraction, and performance visualization.  
It achieves reliable accuracy and includes sample predictions, graphs, and a clean, reproducible code pipeline.
